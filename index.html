            <p>
                Here at Craft Club we use a selection of different paints and
                techniques such as watercolor painting, acrylic painting,
                finger painting, and sketching. We explore different styles,
                such as landscapes, animals, and abstract art.

            <h3>Crafty Kids</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                At Craft Club, kids can expect to engage in a variety of
                hands-on activities, such as, decopatch, mosaics, sculpting,
                felting, bumpy doodle glazes, quilling, making bath bombs and
                more. This is the perfect place for kids to express themselves
                and have fun.

            <h3>Clay Play</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                We teach different pottery techniques and materials, such as
                clay, glazes, and firing methods. Start with pouring moulds,
                carefully remove and begin shaping and refining it with tools
                and their own creativity. They will then decorate and glaze
                their pottery. Each child will have their own finished pottery
                piece that they can take home and proudly display.
