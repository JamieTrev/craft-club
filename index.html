            <p>
                There are many types of painting and drawing activities that kids can enjoy, such as watercolor
                painting, acrylic
                painting, finger painting, and sketching. They can also explore different styles and themes, such as
                landscapes,
                animals, and abstract art. With the right materials and guidance, painting and drawing can be a
                wonderful way for kids

            <h3>Crafty Kids</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                At our craft club, kids can expect to engage in a variety of exciting and hands-on activities, such as,
                decopatch, mosaics, sculpting, felting, making bath bombs, bumpy doodle glazes,
                quilling, and more. Our experienced instructors will guide your child through each project and provide
                them
                with the tools and materials they need to bring their ideas to life.
                This is the perfect place for kids to
                express themselves and have fun. They'll learn new skills, develop their imagination, and make memories
                that will last a
                lifetime.

            <h3>Clay Play</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Children will learn different pottery techniques and materials, such as clay, glazes, and firing
                methods.

                Start with pouring moulds, carefully remove the piece and begin shaping
                and refining it with tools and their own creativity. They will then decorate and glaze their pottery.

                At the end of the class, each child will have their own finished pottery piece that they can take home
                and proudly
                display.
