Was stuck on why my css styling would not show in the browser to then realise I had not linked my stylesheet to my html.

Images are not uploading, once clicked and dragged, the upload status remained at 0 out of ?.
Found out they would not upload because the file size was too big. I reduced the size using <https://tinypng.com/>

I downloaded ? images from www.pexels.com.ff

I decided to choose a colour palette from colorhunt.co

I am unsure how to center the club ethos section on a screen width less than 1200px, will now allow me to use the backspace button or the enter button to move down to a new line, since moving to this workspace, I am unable to use a predictive code elements that I am writing.
