## Testing 

I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Fireox and Safari.

I have tested the responsiveness of the website ensuring that it looks good and functions on all screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.

I have designed the navigation, header, home, gallery and make booking are all readable and easy to understand.

I have tested that the make booking form works: requires entries in mandatory fields, only accepts an email in the email field, and the send button works.


### Bugs

## Solved bugs

When I checked my code in the browser, none of the styling was being applied until I realised I had not used the correct file path to the stylesheet.

Images were not uploading: I would drag the images I wanted to the images folder but the upload status remained at 0 for many minutes until I realised the file size I was trying to upload were too big.
I reduced the size using <https://tinypng.com/>

## Unsolved bugs

I have had continuous issues with my README file in which certain keys of my computer keyboard will not respond. The backspace and enter keys are not working and like the template I was using at the beginning of this project, I now do not have short hand use of syntax which takes significantly longer.

### Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
Then navigate to pages on the left hand side.
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch.
Once the Main Branch has been selected, the page provided the link to the completed website after a couple of minutes.
